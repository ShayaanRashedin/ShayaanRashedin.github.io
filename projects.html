    <!-- 3. Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions -->
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-header">Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <h3>Current File Permissions</h3>
        <p>This document displays the file structure of the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory and the permissions of the files and subdirectory it contains.</p>
        <p>In the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory, there are five files with the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>project_k.txt</code>: User = read, write; Group = read, write; Other = read, write</li>
          <li><code>project_m.txt</code>: User = read, write; Group = read; Other = none</li>
          <li><code>project_r.txt</code>: User = read, write; Group = read, write; Other = read</li>
          <li><code>project_t.txt</code>: User = read, write; Group = read, write; Other = read</li>
          <li><code>.project_x.txt</code>: User = read, write; Group = write; Other = none</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is also one subdirectory named <code>drafts</code> with permissions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User = read, write, execute</li>
          <li>Group = execute</li>
          <li>Other = none</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In this activity, I acted as a security professional managing file and directory permissions for a research team. My main goal was to analyze current permissions, determine if they matched authorization policies, and use Linux commands to correct any discrepancies. This ensured that only the appropriate users could access or modify specific files and directories.</p>

        <h3>Check File and Directory Details</h3>
        <p>To inspect the current file and directory permissions, I used the following command:</p>
        <pre><code class="bash">ls -la /home/researcher2/projects</code></pre>
        <p>This lists all files (including hidden), their permission strings, ownerships, and other details, helping identify which needed adjustment.</p>

        <h3>Describe the Permissions String</h3>
        <p>One example string is:</p>
        <pre><code class="bash">-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 researcher2 1234 project_k.txt</code></pre>
        <p>This breaks down as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>-</code>: Regular file</li>
          <li><code>rw-</code>: User (owner) has read/write</li>
          <li><code>rw-</code>: Group has read/write</li>
          <li><code>r--</code>: Others have read only</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Change File Permissions</h3>
        <p>The organization prohibits write for "others." To correct <code>project_k.txt</code>:</p>
        <p><strong>Command used:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="bash">chmod o-w /home/researcher2/projects/project_k.txt</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="bash">-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 researcher2 1234 project_k.txt</code></pre>

        <h3>Change Permissions on Hidden File</h3>
        <p>For <code>.project_x.txt</code>, only user and group should read:</p>
        <p><strong>Command used:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="bash">chmod 440 /home/researcher2/projects/.project_x.txt</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="bash">-r--r----- 1 researcher2 researcher2 987 .project_x.txt</code></pre>

        <h3>Change Directory Permissions</h3>
        <p>To restrict <code>drafts</code> to researcher2 only:</p>
        <p><strong>Command used:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="bash">chmod 700 /home/researcher2/projects/drafts</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="bash">drwx------ 2 researcher2 researcher2 4096 drafts</code></pre>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In this exercise, I checked file and directory permissions using <code>ls -la</code>, interpreted the permission strings, and modified access controls with <code>chmod</code>. I ensured only authorized users had appropriate rights, revoking unnecessary permissions. This aligned the system with secure access policies and supported organizational data protection efforts.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
            In this project, I acted as a security professional investigating potential security threats within a large organization. I used SQL queries with filtering conditions (<code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>LIKE</code>) to analyze login attempts and employee data. The goal was to identify unusual login activity and update machine security for employees in specific departments. Through this process, I demonstrated the ability to filter datasets efficiently to identify potential threats.
            </p>

            <h3>Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts</h3>
            <pre><code>SELECT *
        FROM log_in_attempts
        WHERE login_time &gt; '18:00'
        AND (success = 0 OR success = FALSE);
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates</h3>
            <pre><code>SELECT *
        FROM log_in_attempts
        WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09'
        OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico</h3>
            <pre><code>SELECT *
        FROM log_in_attempts
        WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%'
        AND country NOT LIKE 'Mexico%';
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Retrieve Employees in Marketing</h3>
            <pre><code>SELECT *
        FROM employees
        WHERE department = 'Marketing'
        AND office LIKE 'East%';
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales</h3>
            <pre><code>SELECT *
        FROM employees
        WHERE department = 'Finance'
        OR department = 'Sales';
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Retrieve All Employees Not in IT</h3>
            <pre><code>SELECT *
        FROM employees
        WHERE department != 'Information Technology';
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
            In this project, I applied SQL filtering techniques to identify login anomalies and assist in machine updates for specific employee groups. Using a variety of operators and the <code>LIKE</code> keyword, I successfully queried relevant data to support security investigations. This exercise demonstrated my proficiency in filtering datasets and using SQL to address real-world cybersecurity issues.

            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>This qualitative assessment used the NIST SP 800-30 framework to score threats based on public accessibility and authentication reliance. Likelihood and severity reflect attacker capability and impact. Focus is on cyber-based vectors.</p>

            <h4>Remediation Strategy</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Implement Principle of Least Privilege so employees only access necessary data.</li>
            <li>Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to block stolen-credential access.</li>
            <li>Restrict the server behind a VPN or firewall to remove public exposure.</li>
            <li>Deploy monitoring and logging tools to detect anomalies and support response.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
            A ransomware incident occurred at a small U.S. healthcare clinic due to a phishing attack. This entry details the event and its key elements.
            </p>

            <h3>The 5 W’s</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Who:</strong> An organized group of unethical hackers targeting healthcare and transportation sectors.</li>
            <li><strong>What:</strong> Employees received phishing emails containing malicious attachments. When opened, the malware encrypted the clinic’s critical files and a ransom note was displayed.</li>
            <li><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m.</li>
            <li><strong>Where:</strong> At a small U.S. healthcare clinic specializing in primary-care services.</li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> The attack occurred because employees opened phishing emails with malicious attachments that installed ransomware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
            <p>
            Immediate containment and recovery measures are required. The organization should notify authorities, begin forensic investigation, and implement stronger phishing protections. User awareness training and a reliable data backup strategy should also be prioritized.

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
            You are a security professional at a healthcare company, tasked with maintaining a list of employee IP addresses that are permitted to access a restricted subnetwork. This list, stored in <code>allow_list.txt</code>, must be regularly updated to remove any IPs identified in a separate <code>remove_list</code> that denotes revoked access. The goal of the algorithm is to identify and remove any IPs listed in the remove list from the allow list file using Python.
            </p>

            <h3>Open the File in Read Mode</h3>
            <pre><code>with open("allow_list.txt", "r") as file:
            ip_addresses = file.read()
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Split Contents into a List</h3>
            <pre><code>ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Iterate Through the Remove List</h3>
            <pre><code>remove_list = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.5"]
        for ip in remove_list:
            if ip in ip_addresses:
                ip_addresses.remove(ip)
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Write the Updated List Back to the File</h3>
            <pre><code>with open("allow_list.txt", "w") as file:
            file.write("\n".join(ip_addresses))
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
            This Python algorithm automates the upkeep of an IP allow-list by:
            <ol>
                <li>Reading the existing list from <code>allow_list.txt</code>.</li>
                <li>Parsing it into a Python list for easy manipulation.</li>
                <li>Removing any addresses found in a predefined <code>remove_list</code>.</li>
                <li>Writing the cleaned list back to the original file.</li>
            </ol>
            By automating these steps, it ensures that only currently authorized IPs retain access, strengthening network security through up-to-date access controls.
