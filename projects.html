  <h2>About These Projects</h2>
  <p>
    The projects below were completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Each project simulates a realistic security scenario and focuses on core skills used in the field, including network defense, vulnerability assessment, incident response, log analysis, Linux access control, and security automation. I treated each scenario like an actual engagement by analyzing the environment, identifying risks, and proposing or implementing technical and procedural controls.

    <div class="accordion-header">Analyzing Network Structure and Security</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I acted as a cybersecurity analyst at a multimedia company that offers web, graphic, and social media services. After the company experienced a distributed denial of service attack that sent a large volume of ICMP packets through an unconfigured firewall and brought internal services offline for two hours, I developed a security improvement plan based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. I focused on firewall misconfigurations, DDoS response, and long term network hardening to prevent similar attacks in the future.
      </p>

      <h3>Implemented Controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a firewall rule to rate limit incoming ICMP packets.</li>
        <li>Enabled source IP verification on the firewall to prevent spoofed addresses.</li>
        <li>Deployed network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.</li>
        <li>Installed and tuned an IDS and IPS to filter suspicious ICMP traffic.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Network Security Improvement Plan Based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework</h3>

      <h4>Identify</h4>
      <p>
        Conduct regular audits of networks, devices, and access privileges to uncover misconfigurations such as unconfigured firewall rules. Perform vulnerability scans on firewalls and network equipment.
      </p>

      <h4>Protect</h4>
      <p>
        Enforce security policies that require proper firewall configuration, protocol rate limiting, source IP validation, and network segmentation. Train staff on incident response and firewall management.
      </p>

      <h4>Detect</h4>
      <p>
        Deploy network monitoring and anomaly detection tools to alert on traffic spikes. Configure IDS and IPS signatures and thresholds to catch DDoS behavior before service disruption.
      </p>

      <h4>Respond</h4>
      <p>
        Develop a DDoS specific incident response playbook that defines roles, communications, and escalation procedures. Conduct tabletop exercises to validate readiness.
      </p>

      <h4>Recover</h4>
      <p>
        Maintain backups of critical network configurations and system states. Establish rapid service restoration procedures and perform post incident reviews to update controls and lessons learned.

  <!-- 2. Identifying Vulnerabilities for a Small Business -->
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">Identifying Vulnerabilities for a Small Business</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted a hands on vulnerability assessment of a publicly accessible Linux server that hosts a MySQL database for a fictional ecommerce organization. The database server is critical for the business and has been exposed to the internet for three years with no inbound firewall restrictions. It runs Linux, allows remote employee access worldwide, communicates with internal systems over IPv4, and uses SSL and TLS to protect data in transit. Using the NIST SP 800 30 framework, I analyzed threats, estimated the likelihood and impact of different attack scenarios, and proposed remediation strategies to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
      </p>

      <h3>System Description</h3>
      <p>
        The server uses a high performance CPU, 128 GB RAM, the latest Linux operating system, and MySQL. It supports global remote access with SSL and TLS and it is directly reachable from the internet with no firewall access control lists limiting inbound database traffic.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        This assessment focuses on protecting customer data on the exposed database server. It does not cover physical security or other infrastructure. The three month evaluation followed NIST SP 800 30 guidance.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The database is essential for sales and marketing. A breach could result in data theft, downtime, legal exposure, and reputational damage. My goal was to identify vulnerabilities before they could be exploited and to recommend effective defensive controls.
      </p>

      <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
      <table class="checklist-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Threat Source</th>
            <th>Threat Event</th>
            <th>Likelihood</th>
            <th>Severity</th>
            <th>Risk (L × S)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Cybercriminals</td>
            <td>Exfiltrate customer data using SQL injection</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>9</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Insider employee</td>
            <td>Misuse credentials to access restricted data</td>
            <td>2</td>

            <td>6</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Competitor</td>
            <td>Launch a DDoS attack to disrupt operations</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Following NIST SP 800 30 Revision 1, I scored threats based on attacker capability and system exposure. I estimated likelihood and severity using threat actor profiles and the potential business impact. I focused mainly on cyber based attack vectors because the server is publicly exposed.
      </p>

      <h3>Remediation Strategy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement the Principle of Least Privilege to restrict data access by role.</li>
        <li>Enforce Multi Factor Authentication for all database accounts.</li>
        <li>Restrict server access behind a VPN or strict firewall access control lists.</li>
        <li>Deploy continuous monitoring and perform regular vulnerability scans.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="accordion-header">Conducting a Security Audit</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I performed a cybersecurity audit and compliance assessment for Botium Toys, a fictional retail company that operates both a physical storefront and an online e commerce platform and handles sensitive customer payment card data and personal information. I evaluated their existing security controls across technology, processes, and policy and compared them to PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2 requirements. I then identified high risk gaps and delivered prioritized recommendations to strengthen the security posture and reduce regulatory and business risk.

  <!-- 4. Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions -->
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I acted as a security analyst supporting a research team in a large organization. I audited and corrected file and directory permissions within a Linux environment to make sure that users only had the appropriate level of access that matched organizational security policies. I inspected file permissions in the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory, identified unnecessary or unsafe permissions such as public write access, and used Linux commands to fix them so that only authorized users retained access.
      </p>

      <h3>Check File and Directory Details</h3>
      <p>To inspect the current file and directory permissions, I used:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">ls -la /home/researcher2/projects</code></pre>

      <h3>Describe the Permissions String</h3>
      <p>Example permissions string:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 researcher2 1234 project_k.txt</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular file</li>
        <li>User has read and write</li>
        <li>Group has read and write</li>
        <li>Others have read only</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Change File Permissions</h3>
      <p>The organization prohibits write access for others. To correct <code>project_k.txt</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">chmod o-w /home/researcher2/projects/project_k.txt</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 researcher2 1234 project_k.txt</code></pre>

      <h3>Change Permissions on a Hidden File</h3>
      <p>For <code>.project_x.txt</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">chmod 440 /home/researcher2/projects/.project_x.txt</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-r--r----- 1 researcher2 researcher2 987 .project_x.txt</code></pre>

      <h3>Change Directory Permissions</h3>
      <p>To restrict the <code>drafts</code> directory to researcher2 only:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">chmod 700 /home/researcher2/projects/drafts</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
      <pre><code class="bash">drwx------ 2 researcher2 researcher2 4096 drafts</code></pre>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        I checked file and directory permissions using <code>ls -la</code>, interpreted the permissions string, and modified access controls using <code>chmod</code>. I ensured that only authorized users had appropriate rights and I removed unnecessary permissions for others. This aligned the system with secure access policies and supported organizational data protection efforts.

      Importing and Parsing a Text File in a Security Related Scenario
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I acted as a security professional at a fictional healthcare company and was responsible for maintaining a list of employee IP addresses that are allowed to access a restricted subnetwork. The list is stored in a file named <code>allow_list.txt</code> and must be kept up to date by removing any IP addresses that appear in a separate list of revoked addresses. I wrote a Python script that opens and parses the allow list, removes any addresses that appear in the revoke list, and then writes the cleaned list back to the file so that only currently authorized IPs keep access.
      </p>

      <h3>Open and Read the File</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">with open("allow_list.txt", "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read().split()
</code></pre>

      <h3>Iterate and Remove</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">remove_list = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.5"]
for ip in remove_list:
    if ip in ip_addresses:
        ip_addresses.remove(ip)
</code></pre>

      <h3>Write the Updated List</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">with open("allow_list.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("\n".join(ip_addresses))
</code></pre>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This Python workflow automates access control by reading the existing allow list file, parsing it into a list, removing any revoked IP addresses, and writing the updated list back to disk. The result is a self updating allow list that reflects current authorization policy.

    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I acted as the incident handler for a simulated ransomware attack against a small United States healthcare clinic. The attack began when a staff member opened a phishing email with a malicious attachment that deployed ransomware and encrypted critical medical and administrative files. I documented the event in an incident handler journal using an investigative framework based on the Five Ws Who, What, When, Where, and Why to capture key details, assess impact, and recommend response and recovery actions.
      </p>

      <h3>Incident Handler Journal Entry</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 26, 2025</p>

      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        A ransomware incident occurred at a small United States healthcare clinic following a phishing email. This entry records the event and its key elements.
      </p>

      <h4>Tools Used</h4>
      <p>
        No specific cybersecurity tools were mentioned in the scenario. Tooling had not yet been deployed.
      </p>

      <h4>The Five Ws</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> An organized group of unethical hackers targeting healthcare and transportation sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> Employees received phishing emails with malicious attachments that encrypted critical files and displayed a ransom note.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> A small healthcare clinic in the United States that provides primary care services.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> The attack succeeded because employees opened phishing emails with malicious attachments that installed ransomware.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
      <p>
        Immediate containment and recovery measures are required. The organization should notify authorities, begin forensic investigation, and implement stronger phishing protections. User awareness training and a reliable data backup strategy should also be prioritized.
