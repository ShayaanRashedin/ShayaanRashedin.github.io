      <h2>Drafting a Professional Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a computer engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity and a hands-on approach to solving technical problems. I bring a solid foundation in systems, networks, and security principles, and I’m actively building experience through labs, certifications, and projects. I’m passionate about protecting people and organizations from digital threats and continuously developing the skills needed to contribute to secure, reliable systems. I’m seeking opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, learn from experts, and help strengthen an organization’s cybersecurity posture.
