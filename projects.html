    <div class="accordion-header">Analyzing Network Structure and Security</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I developed a network security improvement plan based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to harden a fictional multimedia company’s internal network after a DDoS attack compromised services for two hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        I acted as a cybersecurity analyst at a multimedia firm offering web, graphic, and social‐media services. The company suffered a DDoS attack via a flood of ICMP packets through an unconfigured firewall, bringing the internal network offline for two hours. The incident response team blocked ICMP traffic, halted non‐critical services, and restored essential functions.
      </p>

      <h3>Implemented Controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a firewall rule to rate-limit incoming ICMP packets.</li>
        <li>Enabled source IP verification on the firewall to prevent spoofed addresses.</li>
        <li>Deployed network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.</li>
        <li>Installed and tuned an IDS/IPS to filter suspicious ICMP traffic. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Network Security Improvement Plan (NIST CSF)</h3>

      <h4>Identify</h4>
      <p>
        Conduct regular audits of networks, devices, and access privileges to uncover misconfigurations (e.g., unconfigured firewall rules). Perform vulnerability scans on firewalls and network equipment.
      </p>

      <h4>Protect</h4>
      <p>
        Enforce security policies ensuring proper firewall configuration, protocol rate limiting, source IP validation, and network segmentation. Train staff on incident response and firewall management. 
      </p>

      <h4>Detect</h4>
      <p>
        Deploy network monitoring and anomaly-detection tools to alert on traffic spikes. Configure IDS/IPS signatures and thresholds to catch DDoS behavior before service disruption.
      </p>

      <h4>Respond</h4>
      <p>
        Develop a DDoS-specific incident response playbook outlining roles, communications, and escalation procedures. Conduct tabletop exercises to validate readiness. 
      </p>

      <h4>Recover</h4>
      <p>
        Maintain backups of critical network configurations and system states. Establish rapid service restoration procedures and perform post-incident reviews to update controls and lessons learned.

  <!-- 3. Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions -->
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        In this activity, I acted as a security professional managing file and directory permissions for a fictional research team. My main goal was to analyze current permissions, determine if they matched authorization policies, and use Linux commands to correct any discrepancies. This ensured that only the appropriate users could access or modify specific files and directories.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        As a Security Analyst working with a research team in a large organization, I was tasked with auditing and correcting file and directory permissions within a Linux environment. The objective was to ensure users had only the appropriate level of access, in alignment with organizational security policies. This activity involved analyzing permission settings on files and directories within the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory. Based on the assessment, I used Linux commands to correct any misconfigurations—specifically focusing on removing unnecessary write access, securing hidden files, and ensuring restricted directories were only accessible to authorized users.
      </p>

      <h3>Check File and Directory Details</h3>
      <p>To inspect the current file and directory permissions, I used:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">ls -la /home/researcher2/projects</code></pre>

      <h3>Describe the Permissions String</h3>
      <p>Example permissions string:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 researcher2 1234 project_k.txt</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-</code>: Regular file</li>
        <li><code>rw-</code>: User has read &amp; write</li>
        <li><code>rw-</code>: Group has read &amp; write</li>
        <li><code>r--</code>: Others have read only</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Change File Permissions</h3>
      <p>The organization prohibits write access for “others.” To correct <code>project_k.txt</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">chmod o-w /home/researcher2/projects/project_k.txt</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 researcher2 1234 project_k.txt</code></pre>

      <h3>Change Permissions on a Hidden File</h3>
      <p>For <code>.project_x.txt</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">chmod 440 /home/researcher2/projects/.project_x.txt</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-r--r----- 1 researcher2 researcher2 987 .project_x.txt</code></pre>

      <h3>Change Directory Permissions</h3>
      <p>To restrict the <code>drafts</code> directory to researcher2 only:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">chmod 700 /home/researcher2/projects/drafts</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
      <pre><code class="bash">drwx------ 2 researcher2 researcher2 4096 drafts</code></pre>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        In this exercise, I checked file and directory permissions using <code>ls -la</code>, interpreted the permissions string, and modified access controls with <code>chmod</code>. I ensured only authorized users had appropriate rights, revoking unnecessary permissions for others. This aligned the system with secure access policies, supporting organizational data protection efforts.

    <div class="accordion-header">Applying Filters to SQL Queries</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I investigated potential security threats within a fictional corporate environment by querying employee and login activity data. Through SQL, I applied logical filters to detect anomalies such as failed login attempts outside business hours, activity from non-domestic locations, and device update needs by department. This exercise emphasized the use of <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, <code>NOT</code>, and <code>LIKE</code> operators for real-world threat detection. 
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        As a security professional at a large organization, I was tasked with analyzing two key datasets—<code>log_in_attempts</code> and <code>employees</code>—to identify suspicious behavior such as failed logins outside business hours, access from unknown locations, and machines needing updates. 
      </p>

      <h3>Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts</h3>
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00'
  AND (success = 0 OR success = FALSE);
</code></pre>

      <h3>Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates</h3>
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09'
   OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
</code></pre>

      <h3>Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico</h3>
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%'
  AND country NOT LIKE 'Mexico%';
</code></pre>

      <h3>Retrieve Employees in Marketing</h3>
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing'
  AND office LIKE 'East%';
</code></pre>

      <h3>Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales</h3>
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance'
   OR department = 'Sales';
</code></pre>

      <h3>Retrieve All Employees Not in IT</h3>
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department != 'Information Technology';
</code></pre>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This activity demonstrated my ability to apply SQL filtering techniques—using logical operators, date/time conditions, and pattern matching—to identify security-relevant anomalies in login and employee data.

      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, the organization’s database server—critical for business operations and storing customer data—has been online and publicly accessible for three years. It runs Linux, hosts MySQL, supports remote employee access worldwide, and uses SSL/TLS for data transmission. This exercise simulated a real-world assessment following NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. 
      </p>

      <h3>System Description</h3>
      <p>
        The server features a high-performance CPU and 128 GB RAM, latest Linux OS, and MySQL. It communicates over IPv4 with internal servers, allows global remote access, and secures connections via SSL/TLS. No firewall restrictions exist for inbound database traffic.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        This assessment focuses on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data on the publicly accessible database server. It excludes physical security and other IT infrastructure. The three-month evaluation followed NIST SP 800-30 guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The database is essential for sales and marketing. A breach could lead to data theft, legal issues, reputational harm, and operational downtime. This report aims to identify vulnerabilities before exploitation and recommend controls to mitigate risk.

This list, stored in <code>allow_list.txt</code>, must be regularly updated to remove any IPs identified in a separate <code>remove_list</code> of revoked addresses. The goal is to automate the removal of any IPs in the remove list from the allow list using Python. 
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        I simulate a real-world network admin task: given <code>allow_list.txt</code> containing authorized IPs and a predefined <code>remove_list</code>, write a Python script to filter out revoked addresses and update the file. This ensures only currently authorized IPs retain access.
      </p>

      <h3>Open & Read the File</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">with open("allow_list.txt", "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read().split()
</code></pre>

      <h3>Iterate & Remove</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">remove_list = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.5"]
for ip in remove_list:
    if ip in ip_addresses:
        ip_addresses.remove(ip)
</code></pre>

      <h3>Write the Updated List</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">with open("allow_list.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("\n".join(ip_addresses))
</code></pre>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This Python algorithm automates access control by:  
        1. Reading the existing allow-list file.<br>
        2. Parsing its contents into a list.<br>
        3. Removing any IPs found in a predefined revoke list.<br>
        4. Writing the cleaned list back to the file.  
        The result is a self-updating allow-list that reflects current authorization policies.
